# python-snake-game
Classic Snake Game built using Python Turtle module

# What I Learned / Revised from This Project
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Class separation (Snake, Food, Scoreboard)
- Game loop using `while` and `time.sleep()`
- Collision detection logic
- Keyboard event handling
- Screen update optimization using `tracer()`
  
# Technologies Used
- Python
- Turtle module
- OOP principles
  
# How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `main.py` using Python
3. Use arrow keys to control the snake

#  Purpose
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of Python OOP and game logic.
